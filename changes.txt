   Delays minimized and more:

    * Timestamps in debug log
    * Useless periodic config update is disabled by default
    * Proper config handling, exit if config failed at startup
    * max_retry_count is 0 by default
    * Don't do last sleep(2) after last retry
    * Per-host negative cache for errors ECONNREFUSED and ETIMEDOUT
